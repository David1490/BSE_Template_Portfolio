# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was building the robot arm and hooking up all the wires onto the breadboard and arduino. On the arduino there would be one wire that goes into the ground power and one that goes into the 5 volts. On the other end of the wires, they will be connected to the breadboard, the 5 volts jumper will be connected to the positive column of the bread board, while the ground power jumper will be connected to the negative side of the column. And to connect the servos there will be three wire, one will be connected to the same column as the ground power, one will be connected to the same column as the 5 volts wire, and one will connect from the servo directly to the arduibno digital port. I connected the wires to the PWM ports.
